# @DESCRIPTION:
# Acquire cd(s) for those lovely cd-based emerges.  Yes, this violates
# the whole 'non-interactive' policy, but damnit I want CD support!
#
# With these cdrom functions we handle all the user interaction and
# standardize everything.  All you have to do is call cdrom_get_cds()
# and when the function returns, you can assume that the cd has been
# found at CDROM_ROOT.

# that people will be using these.  If your package optionally supports
# disc based installed, then set this to "yes", and we'll set things
# conditionally based on USE=cdinstall.

# @FUNCTION: cdrom_get_cds
# @USAGE: <file on cd1> [file on cd2] [file on cd3] [...]
# @DESCRIPTION:
# The function will attempt to locate a cd based upon a file that is on
# the cd.  The more files you give this function, the more cds the cdrom
# functions will handle.
#
# Normally the cdrom functions will refer to the cds as 'cd #1', 'cd #2',
# etc...  If you want to give the cds better names, then just export
# the appropriate CDROM_NAME variable before calling cdrom_get_cds().
# Use CDROM_NAME for one cd, or CDROM_NAME_# for multiple cds.  You can
# also use the CDROM_NAMES bash array.
#
# For those multi cd ebuilds, see the cdrom_load_next_cd() function.
