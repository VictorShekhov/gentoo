To run znc as a user, run 'znc --makeconf' to create a configuration file.

If znc was compiled with the 'daemon' use flag, you may run
    emerge --config znc
to configure it.

If migrating from a user-based install, you can copy the existing
configuration files:
     mkdir /var/lib/znc
     mv /home/$USER/.znc/* /var/lib/znc
     rm -rf /home/$USER/.znc
     chown -R znc:znc /var/lib/znc
You may also adjust the location of the files and the user running znc
in /etc/conf.d/znc instead.
